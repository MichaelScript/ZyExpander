# Zybooks-Scripts
Zybooks' default grading/organization system is difficult to work with, this helps organize and parse the default format into something more easy to work with.

# ZyExpander
Zybooks exports student files as nested zip files that aren't even contained in a folder,
this makes it confusing/slow as you cant find students easily and lab files often have the same name.
